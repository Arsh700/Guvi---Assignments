    <h2>The Beginnings of HTTP & The Internet</h2>
    <p>Our story begins in 1969, with a program called Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET). ARPANET used packet switching and allowed multiple computers to communicate with each other on a single network. However, this was just a by-product. The original intention behind ARPANET was to design a time-sharing system that allowed research institutes to share their computer resources for effective utilization of processing power.</p>
    <p>Before then, sometime during the 19th century, the seeds for the existence of the internet as we know it today had already been sown with the invention of electricity and the telegraph. With Morse sending the first telegraphic message in 1844 and the first cable being laid across Atlantic, the telegraph network infrastructure had spread its roots through continents and across oceans. In years to come, this would become the very foundation on which the internet was built. In 1973, Kahn and Cerf designed the TCP/IP protocol suite which was adopted by ARPANET a decade later, and from this point on, we witness the development of an interconnected network. The internet took a more recognizable form with the invention of the World Wide Web (that used HTTP as its underlying protocol) by Tim Berners-Lee and the Commercial Internet eXchange (CIX) that allowed a free exchange of TCP/IP traffic between ISPs.</p>
    <h2>Evolution of HTTP</h2>
    <p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a set of rules that runs on top of the TCP/IP suite of protocols and defines how files are to be transferred between clients and servers on the world wide web.</p>
<h2>The Beginning of HTTP: Version 0.9 & 1.0</h2>
<p>n the earliest phase (HTTP/0.9), the HTTP protocol did not use headers and only transmitted plain HTML files. It was a one-line protocol only supporting the GET method.</p>
